Flow:-
1.3 algorithms are used for Ranking 
 1.weighted_popularity_ranking:
        weighted_popularity_ranking that aims to rank news articles based on a calculated "weighted popularity score" using engagement metrics like reaction count, comment count, and share count.
2.TF-IDF
performs a different method of ranking articles based on their titles using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scoring.

shows the article titles alongside their corresponding TF-IDF scores, providing a ranking of articles based on the uniqueness and importance of words in their titles according to the TF-IDF algorithm.
3.neural network model(LSTM)

appears to create a neural network-based ranking system for articles based on their engagement features, utilizing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model


nutshell:
Ranking Generation:

Three ranking algorithms are applied to the dataset (df): weighted_popularity_ranking, tfidf_ranking, and neural_network_ranking. These algorithms generate ranked lists of articles based on different criteria like weighted popularity, TF-IDF score, and neural network score.
Comparison of Rankings:

Extracts top-ranked articles from each algorithm to compare their rankings.
Calculates Kendall's Tau and Spearman's Rank Correlation between pairs of ranked lists to assess the degree of similarity or correlation between rankings:
For instance, comparing the rankings between Weighted and TF-IDF, and between TF-IDF and Neural Network.
Mean Average Precision (MAP) Calculation:

Simulates relevance scores for the top-K items across different rankings (in this case, considering the top 10 articles).
Calculates Average Precision (AP) for each ranking method.
Computes the Mean Average Precision (MAP) across all rankings. MAP provides a single metric to compare the overall performance of different ranking algorithms.
